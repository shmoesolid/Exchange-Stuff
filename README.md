# Exchange Stuff (Trade Off)

## Description

This is UTSA Coding Bootcamp's project #2.  We created a trade only system that allows you to post various items based on your declared monentary values.  You can browse other user's tradable items that that are of comparable values and either accept or refuse that trade.  That trade will not be seen again unless the user resets the listings for their item.  Once a trade is accepted, the items for both users will be under the trade section in the dashboard.
